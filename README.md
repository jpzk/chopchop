Hello this is the tutorial of chopchopchop. Use the keys hjkl or arrow keys to move arround. [h or arrow-left] is for going left, [l or arrow-right] is for going right. It allows you to read through the text word by word. [j or arrow-down] is going down lines, and [k or arrow-up] is for going lines up. [f] is for changing font styles and [t] is for changing color themes. Finally [s] is for font size. If you want to read a text on a website with this reader just change the url parameter in the address! Now it's time to try it out.
